/**
 * \brief Compare some value with a CTDB entry
 *
 *  \par Description
 *       This function is used by RBT as a function pointer for generic search and insert
 *       comparisons in the CTDB. We are currently using sequence IDs as the primary key
 *       for the CTDB RBT, and then if two nodes' keys match, making further comparisons
 *       against their respective sequence numbers.
 *
 *  \par Assumptions, External Events, and Notes:
 *       This function is called as a function pointer by \ref BPLib_RBT_InsertValueGeneric
 *       and \ref BPLib_RBT_SearchGeneric.
 * 
 *  \param[in] Node Pointer to a red-black tree link
 *  \param[in] Arg Pointer to a sequence number to compare against
 *
 *  \retval 0 if this node matches the sequence number (Arg)
 *  \retval 1 if the sequence number (Arg) is greater than the current node's sequence number
 *  \retval -1 if the sequence number (Arg) is less than the current node's sequence number
